                years ago, provides ocean tides, stabilizes the axial
                tilt, and gradually slows the planet’s rotation.

            <dt>
                <p>Pollution is the toxins that mix in the natural environment and harm both human beings and animals. Plants also get affected by pollution. There are many forms of pollution, like air, water, soil, and noise pollution. However, there are other forms of pollution, light pollution, radioactive pollution, and so on. Natural and human activities both contribute to pollution. Volcanic eruptions or oil and gas leakage can cause pollution.</p>
                <p>Human activities cause most of the pollution. It is because of the commercialization of natural things. Humans turn many natural things into human-made things to satisfy their needs. We use more than our needs, which adversely affects nature. The gases from vehicles and factories pollute the air. The land and water are polluted by solid garbage from factories, households, and so on. In rural areas, agricultural wastes, pesticides cause pollution. The noise pollution is caused by the massive sound of music, vehicles, and machinery. The pollution also leads to global warming.</p>
                <p>We cannot completely remove pollution, but we can surely reduce it by implementing a few preventive measures.</p>
                <p>To increase oxygen in the air and make the air pure, we must plant trees on a large level. We should use natural things judiciously. We have to understand the difference between need and want. To decrease the level of land and water pollution, we must avoid using plastic bags. We should use vehicles less to decrease air pollution and noise pollution. We should maintain a proper drainage system to protect the water from getting polluted. We cannot stop natural activities, but we can control our actions. If we do so, we can minimize the impacts of pollution in nature.                </p>

            <dt>
                <p>Global warming or climate change has today become a major threat to the mankind. The Earth’s temperature is on the rise and there are various reasons for it such as greenhouse gases emanating from carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, burning of fossil fuels or deforestation.</p>
                <p>The rise in the levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) leads to substantial increase in temperature. It is because CO2 remains concentrated in the atmosphere for even hundreds of years. Due to activities like fossil fuel combustion for electricity generation, transportation, and heating, human beings have contributed to increase in the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.</p>
                <p>Recent years have been unusually warm, causing worldwide concern. But the fact is that the increase in carbon dioxide actually began in 1800, due to the deforestation of a large chunk of North-eastern American, besides forested parts of the world. The things became worse with emissions in the wake of the industrial revolution, leading to increase in carbon dioxide level by 1900.</p>
                <p>According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global temperature is likely to rise by about 1-3.5 Celsius by the year 2100. It has also suggested that the climate might warm by as much as 10 degrees Fahrenheit over the next 100 years.</p>
                <b style="color: bisque;">Impacts of Global Warming</b> <ul>
                <li>The sea levels are constantly rising as fresh water marshlands, low-lying cities, and islands have been inundated with seawater.</li>
                <li>There have been changes in rainfall patterns, leading to droughts and fires in some areas, and flooding in other areas.</li>
                <li>Ice caps are constantly melting posing a threat to polar bears as their feeding season stands reduced.</li>
                <li>Glaciers are gradually melting.</li>
                <li>Animal populations are gradually vanishing as there has been a widespread loss of their habitat.</li>
            </ul>   
                <p>As per Kyoto protocol, developed countries are required to cut back their emissions. There is a need to reduce coal-fired electricity, increase energy efficiency through wind and solar power, and also high efficiency natural gas generation</p>

            <dd id="Aci"><b>Acid Rain</b></dd>
            <dt>
                <p>Acid rain, or acid deposition, is a broad term that includes any form of precipitation with acidic components, such as sulfuric or nitric acid that fall to the ground from the atmosphere in wet or dry forms.  This can include rain, snow, fog, hail or even dust that is acidic.</p>
                <p>Acid rain results when sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) are emitted into the atmosphere and transported by wind and air currents. The SO2 and NOX react with water, oxygen and other chemicals to form sulfuric and nitric acids.  These then mix with water and other materials before falling to the ground.</p>
                <p>While a small portion of the SO2 and NOX that cause acid rain is from natural sources such as volcanoes, most of it comes from the burning of fossil fuels.  The major sources of SO2 and NOX in the atmosphere are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Burning of fossil fuels to generate electricity.  Two thirds of SO2 and one fourth of NOX in the atmosphere come from electric power generators.</li>
                    <li>Vehicles and Heavy Equipments</li>
                    <li>Manufacturing, oil refineries and other industries.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Winds can blow SO2 and NOX over long distances and across borders making acid rain a problem for everyone and not just those who live close to these sources. </p>
